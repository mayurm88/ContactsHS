About: 
 A simple(in memory) add and search contact application. i.e. Contacts will not be preserved across multiple
 runs of the program.
 A contact is defined as <firstname lastname> and has maximum length 50.
 You can add any contact with the above format and it will be searchable in the application.
 
Assumptions:
 1) If you add/search a name which has more than two words, only the first two words will be taken into
    consideration.
 2) The application is case insensitive. No matter what case you add your contacts in,
    search will always display names in Proper Case.
 3) For erratic inputs, the program will exit.
 4) For special characters in the name, program will throw an error.
