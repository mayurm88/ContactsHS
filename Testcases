Here I am listing down some of the unit test cases that were done. These are manual test cases
and currently no Test framework is used to test this application.

Input Tests

1. Spaces/Tabs in front and back of the name.
    --> App deletes it and stores it in <firstname lastname> format.
2. Spaces/Tabs in middle of the name.
    --> App deletes it and stores it in <firstname lastname> format.
3. Special characters in search/add.
    --> App throws an error "Only Alphabets and spaces allowed. Please try again."
4. Mixed case
    --> App converts to proper case and stores it in <firstname lastname> format.
5. About 100 characters input.
    --> App throws an error "Name too long. Only 50 character names allowed. Please try again."
6. About 200 characters input.
    --> App throws an error "Invalid input. Please try again."
7. EOF.
    --> App throws an error and exits.
8. Entering string when choice(integer) is expected.
    --> App throws an error "Invalid input. Please try again."
9. Entering more than 3 words in add
    --> App does not throw an error. Instead stores the first two words in <firstname lastname> format.
10. Entering more than 3 words in search
    --> App does not throw an error. Instead searches with first two words of the input and gives 
        results if any matched.

Functional tests

1. Add a simple name and search.
    --> Working.
2. Add multiple names and only firstname.
    --> Example: enter John 5 times. Search only shows it once.
3. Add multiple first name with changing second names.
    --> Example:
            Priyanka
            Priyanka Mahajan
            Priyanka Deodhar
            Priyanka Kamkar
        Then search for pri, deo
        Results:
            All Priyankas and <Priyanka Deodhar> respectively.
4. Now add Priyanka as last name.
    --> Example:
            Usha Priyanka
        Search for pri
        Results:
            All Priyankas + Usha Priyanka

5. Search for exact matches.
    --> Example: Search for 'Priyanka'
        Results: Exact match 'Priyanka' comes first.

6. Search for half first names and half last names.
    --> Example: Search for 'Pri Ma'
        Results: Only Priyanka Mahajan is displayed.

7. Search for last names.
    --> Working.

8. Search for full firstname and half lastname.
    --> Example: Search for Priyanka D
        Results: Priyanka Deodhar

9. Search for half firstname and full lastname.
    --> Example: Search for Pri Kamkar
        Results: Priyanka Kamkar
